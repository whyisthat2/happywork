And now i will talk about my projects that i made in the past levels i actually i remember 2 of them and 
i will talk about each of them:
<ol><li>electric car controled by bluetooth</li>
<li>animal tracker gps device</li>
</ol>
<font color="purple">
    <ol><li>the first project i will talk about is the electric car
        first thing that i will be talking about is what is the idea
        its basiclly an electric car controlled by the phone using bluetooth connection
        i used to make it those:</li></ol>

<ul> 
<font color="pink">
<li id="a">the car body</li></font>
<font color="yellow">
<li id="b">aurduino</li></font>
<font color="violet">
<li id="c">bluetooth</li></font>
<font color="blue">
<li id="d">battery</li></font>
<font color="orange">
<li id="e">wires</li></font>
<font color="red">
<li id="f">H-bridge</li>
</ul>

 i connected all of the parts togather to make an electric car that can be used for like transfering thing 
like a book a charger etc. i used fir programming it the aurduino and i actually used some help from google and youtube 
and it worked but i faced a problem that the left and rgiht directios where not moving well or idk maybe the problem\
 from me i couldnt drive it well. :) 
 and it look like this

    2. the second project that i will be talking about is the animal gps tracker
    it a device wee can put it in the animal body and it is like a belt we can put it on the animal
    and then we can track the animl when he went to or like that
    its use for any animal depend on animal size and its easy to use u just need to open the map on blynk app and 
    track the gps this can be used when u are walking your animal an maybe he suddenly vanished bc he say sth he want 
    and you wont know where is he so using this device you will know and it is also can be cgarged by the sun using a solar pannel.
    i used couple of thing to make it wich is:

<ul> 
<font color="pink">
<li id="g">a belt</li></font>
<font color="yellow">
<li id="h">solar pannel</li></font>
<font color="violet">
<li id="i">gps tracker</li></font>
<font color="blue">
<li id="j">battery</li></font>
<font color="orange">
<li id="k">esp</li></font>
<font color="red">
<li id="l">bread board</li>
</ul>
